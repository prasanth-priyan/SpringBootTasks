**Spring Boot Tasks**

Created a movie service API and completed the following tasks

* Complete all the endpoints for CRUD operations on Movie
* Use h2-console to view in-memory data
* Add an endpoint to search movieByName. Understand @Query and parameter passing to
@Query
* Generate API documentation using Swagger 2

* Create custom exceptions MovieNotFoundException, MovieAlreadyExistsException in a
com.stack....exceptions package. Perform appropriate exception handling and propagation
back.
* Running Logic on Startup in Spring. Create seed data to pre-fill the database with movie
information whenever the application starts. Use both approaches:
Approach 1: ApplicationListener<ContextRefreshedEvent>
Approach 2: CommandLineRunner (Find out how it differs from ApplicationRunner)

* Global exception using Controller advice.
* Remove all hardcoded data from the application code to application.properties
    - by using @Value.
    - by using @PropertySource
    - by using Environment
    - by using @ConfigurationProperties (https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/
        Environment.html)
* Add @Lombok
(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QQpEQZbDD9pmW2qrhYsx5N9XYQ5bJ5dM/view)
* Create another service implementation MovieDummyServiceImpl. Use @Primary and
@Qualifier annotations to specify which implementation to use.
* Use @Profile to run the application with the existing service implementation, and the new
MovieDummyServiceImpl implementation.

* Swap in-memory H2 database with MySQL.
* Create two additional properties file application-dev.properties that contains configuration for
H2 and application-prod.properties that contains configurations for MySQL.
